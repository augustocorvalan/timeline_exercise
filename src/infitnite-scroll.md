# Feature add - Infinite horizontal scroll

Problem: The timeline only shows the date range defined at initialization (today -14 to +70 days). Users can't see dates outside this range.

Expected Behavior: When scrolling near the left or right edge, the viewport should automatically extend to show more dates in that direction (infinite scrolling).

## Feedback
- extend_days should be 5 days
