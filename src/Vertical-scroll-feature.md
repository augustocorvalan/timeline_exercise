# Add feature: vertical scroll synchronization

Context:
- Left pane (task titles) and right pane are syncronized in vertical scrolling.

Problem:
- The right pane does not scroll veritcally using the click and drag. Drag only works horizontally.

Task:
- I want to be able to scroll vertically when I click and drag the right pane. And I want the left pane to be synchronized with the right pane when that vertical scroll happens.
